# Local Profile Assistant (LPA) Project

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Local Profile Assistant (LPA) for managing eSIM profiles within devices. The LPA allows devices to store multiple eSIM profiles and switch between them without needing to replace physical SIM cards. This software is intended to facilitate seamless communication with modem devices, handle eSIM profile management, and interact with Subscription Manager Data Preparation (SM-DP+) servers for profile provisioning and management.

## Features

- Communicate with modem devices using AT commands.
- Download, activate, deactivate, and delete eSIM profiles.
- Interface with SM-DP+ servers for eSIM management.
- User-friendly interface for managing eSIM profiles.
- Secure handling of credentials and personal information.
